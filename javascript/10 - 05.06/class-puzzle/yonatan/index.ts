Objects follow-up:

1. Object Creation
Create an object representing a book, 
which has properties like title, author, yearPublished and pages. 
Then, print each property using dot notation.

const book1 = {

    title = New houses;
    author = israel lev;
    yearPublished = 2002;
    numOfPages = 101;

}

const book2 = {

    title = old houses;
    author = ishay lev;
    yearPublished = 2000;
    numOfPages = 99;

}

2. Object Methods
Continuing from the previous exercise, add a method getSummary to the book object, which when called, returns a summary of the book as a string: "title, written by author in yearPublished, contains pages pages".

3. Modifying Object Properties
Add a property isRead to your book object (set to false initially). Then add a method readBook to the book object which changes the value of isRead to true.
