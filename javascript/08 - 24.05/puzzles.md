1. Using Filter and Map Together:
Given an array of numbers, use the filter and map functions to create a new array containing only the squares of the even numbers from the original array.

2. Implementing ForEach:
Implement a function myForEach that takes an array and a callback function and behaves like the forEach method. It should apply the callback function to each element in the array.

Bonus:
1. Creating Custom Filter Function:
Implement your own filter function named myFilter. It should take an array and a callback function that returns a boolean. myFilter should return a new array containing only the elements of the original array for which the callback function returns true.
