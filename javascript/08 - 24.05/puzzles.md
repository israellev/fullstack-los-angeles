class puzzle:

1. Doubling an Array of Numbers
Create a function named squareNumbers that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array with the square of each number. Use the map function to achieve this.
example: from [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] it returns [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

2. Convert list of names to capital letters
Create a function named capitalNames that takes an array of strings and returns a new array with same string in capital first letter. Use the map function to achieve this.
example: from ["john", "smith"] it returns ["John", "Smith"]

3. Type Detector:
Write a function detectType that takes an argument and prints out whether it's a string, number, boolean, function, or an array.

4. Print Shopping List (forEach)
You have a shopping list represented as an array of strings. Use the forEach function to print each item on the shopping list.

5. Grocery Filter (filter): 
You have an array of grocery items. Some of them are healthy and some are not. Use the filter function to create a new array without 'cake' and 'candy' if they're exists.

6. Temperature Conversion (map)
You have an array of temperatures in Fahrenheit. Use the map function to convert each temperature to Celsius and save the results in a new array.


home puzzle:

1. Using Filter and Map Together:
Given an array of numbers, use the filter and map functions to create a new array containing only the squares of the even numbers from the original array.

2. Implementing ForEach:
Implement a function myForEach that takes an array and a callback function and behaves like the forEach method. It should apply the callback function to each element in the array.

Bonus:
1. Creating Custom Filter Function:
Implement your own filter function named myFilter. It should take an array and a callback function that returns a boolean. myFilter should return a new array containing only the elements of the original array for which the callback function returns true.

2. Creating Custom Filter Function:
Implement your own filter function named myFilter. It should take an array and a callback function that returns a boolean. myFilter should return a new array containing only the elements of the original array for which the callback function returns true.
